# Bill Tracker
I decided on developing a **bill tracker** web application that will have the
following features:
* **Log bills, amounts and date**: 
A user will be able to log upcoming household bills manually, and
probably using X companyâ€™s API which will provide the upcoming bill of
the month for the user and so the user does not need to input it
manually.
* **List bills**: 
The user will be able to list and sort all his bills by different factors; such
as date/amount/company.
* **Have a few graphs (this year / last year)**: 
A graph for the user to show analytical data about the bills in terms of
amounts or even the different categories of the bills.
* **Store them somewhere**: 
The user data will be available on a cloud database so the user will be
able to view the data from anywhere.
